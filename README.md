# Regional Sales, Discount & Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes regional sales performance with a focus on how discount strategies affect profit across regions and product categories.

## Business Problem
Despite strong sales across regions, profit varies significantly. The goal was to identify regions and categories where discounts negatively impacted profitability.

## Key Insights
- The West region recorded the highest sales and profit while applying relatively lower discount rates.
- The Central region had high sales but the lowest profit, driven by excessive discounting.
- The Furniture category in the Central region generated zero profit despite heavy discounts.

## Recommendation
- Reduce or eliminate furniture discounts in the Central region.
- Reallocate discount incentives to the West region where they drive profitable growth.
- Monitor discount strategy by category rather than region alone.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Visualization

## Outcome
Clear, data-driven recommendations to improve profitability without reducing overall sales volume.
